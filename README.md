# Game Rules

Players roll the dice to get a score
If the score is not 1 then it is added to their round score
The player can continue to roll or select hold to add their round score to their total score and the turn goes to the next player
If the player rolls a 1 then the round score is reset to zero and the turn goes to the other player
The player to reach 100 first wins.

It is a game of risk vs reward in terms of keeping rolling to increase round score but also risking losing it all
